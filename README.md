## Hi there 👋

My name is Maria, I'm a recent Master of Business Analytics graduate here in Melbourne, Australia!
This GitHub is my newborn, and it will grow along with me as I explore and working on more projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently working in the hospitality industry in a non-technical role, where I develop strong customer insight, problem-solving, and observation skills that inform my analytics projects.
- 🌱 Currently building projects using Excel, Python, and Power BI. 
- 👯 I’m seeking entry-level Data Analyst or Business Analyst roles and would love to connect.
    - Feel free to reach me at maria.ardhiani@gmail.com
